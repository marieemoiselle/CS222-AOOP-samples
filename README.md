# ‚ù£Ô∏è Greetings!
Welcome to **CS 222: Advanced Object-oriented Programming** course! In this course, a comprehensive introduction to C# programming will be provided, covering fundamental concepts such as syntax, data types, and memory allocation, along with practical skills in input/output operations, decision-making, and iterative structures. Students will explore advanced topics like arrays, functions, object-oriented programming, and file handling, while also gaining hands-on experience with Windows Forms and GUI components.
